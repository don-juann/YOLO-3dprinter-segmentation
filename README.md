# Overview
Segmentation model for finding errors in printing process of 3D Printer

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the use of YOLOv11, which is a computer vision model architecture developed by Ultralytics, the creators of the YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models. YOLOv11 supports object detection, segmentation, classification, keypoint detection, and oriented bounding box (OBB) detection.
